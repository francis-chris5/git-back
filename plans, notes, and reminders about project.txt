Git-Back Version Control Interface Application



Virtual-Reality or 3D-World Interface:

	CHECKOUT
		boxes represent branches
		put box on lower shelf to check out that branch
		can only remove from shelf if there's another box on the shelf (there must be an active branch)
		
		when box on bottom shelf it's [commit objects] show up on top shelf
		put commit object into [inbox tray] to checkout that commit
		drop on ground to make new branch from that commit
		pull out of [inbox tray] to return to attached head state
	
	
	REVERT
		move commit to [outbox] tray
		
		
	BLAME
		current commit in [to-do] tray
		move file to inbox tray
		
		
	MERGE
		put box on upper shelf to merge branches
		put both boxes on bottom shelf to cherry pick (pick from right into the left)
		
		
	REMOTE
		have a door to move boxes through?
	
	have a [whiteboard] that displays the "git log --oneline --graph" for active branch
	
	active branch/commit/file has a yellow label
	local branches have a white label
	remote branches have a blue label
	




Important Notes & Things to Look Into:

	stash is being used internally by software (when checking out a previous commit it immediately adds and stashes all files then pops index 0 from stash upon returning from detached head state --DOES NOT RECOVER THEM IN NEW BRANCH SCENARIO YET--). Could this cause problems with existing stashes in the repository




Bug Reporting:

	hit an issue where the program froze up and crashed everything when switching from checking out one commit to checking out an earlier commit. going to terminal to check found out i couldn't do anything because .git/index.lock file already exists. 
		* not sure which function created it
		* found a post on stack overflow -answered own question- where he thoguht it was the result of commands coming in quicker than git could keep up on a slow file system
		** have not been able to recreate yet
