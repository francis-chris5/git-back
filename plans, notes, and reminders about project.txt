Git-Back Version Control Interface Application



Virtual Reality Interface:

	1.)
		Checkout
			the branches will be like boxes
			the commits will be like pieces of paper in the boxes

			grabbing and pulling out a piece of paper checks out that commit

				putting it back in the same box will return from detached head state

				putting it in a new box will create a new branch from that checkout

	2.) 
		the repository will look like a tree
		branches that have commits will have leafs/fruit representing the commits
		tapping a branch will checkout that branch
		picking a leaf/fruit will checkout that commit


	3.) 
		the repository looks like a clothes line with items hung out to dry
		branches are different lines things hang on
		pulling an item off the clothes line checks out the commit it represents (logo on t-shirt or something)
			put in laundry basket to create a new branch
			hang back up to return to attached head state




Important Notes & Things to Look Into:

	stash is being used internally by software (when checking out a previous commit it immediately adds and stashes all files then pops index 0 from stash upon returning from detached head state --DOES NOT RECOVER THEM IN NEW BRANCH SCENARIO YET--). Could this cause problems with existing stashes in the repository




Bug Reporting:

	hit an issue where the program froze up and crashed everything when switching from checking out one commit to checking out an earlier commit. going to terminal to check found out i couldn't do anything because .git/index.lock file already exists. 
		* not sure which function created it
		* found a post on stack overflow -answered own question- where he thoguht it was the result of commands coming in quicker than git could keep up on a slow file system
		** have not been able to recreate yet
