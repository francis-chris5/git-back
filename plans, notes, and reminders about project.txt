Git-Back Version Control Interface Application



Virtual Reality Interface:

	Checkout
		the branches will be like boxes
		the commits will be like pieces of paper in the boxes

		grabbing and pulling out a piece of paper checks out that commit

			putting it back in the same box will return from detached head state

			putting it in a new box will create a new branch from that checkout




Important Notes & Things to Look Into:

	stash is being used internally by software (when checking out a previous commit it immediately adds and stashes all files then pops index 0 from stash upon returning from detached head state --DOES NOT RECOVER THEM IN NEW BRANCH SCENARIO YET--). Could this cause problems with existing stashes in the repository
